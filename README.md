# FCQ_implementation
Implementation of the FCQ method to derive LOSVDs from absorption line spectra. Program to perform spatial S/N binning to long-slit-spectoscropy data. Long-Slit-Spectoscropy data of of NGC 4697 aswell as an adequate template star spectrum (both in fits format):


1.) The galactic spectrum should be spatially rebinned using the Binning_SN_spectra.py program.
    (the data access for the fits filse is also shown in this program)
    
2.) Perform the FCQ algorithm and derive the Gau√ü-Hermite values of the reconstructed LOSVDs using the fcq_implementation.py program
